# ASSIGNMENT


1 There were 2 dataset of images, first dataset was consist of modak image & second Dataset was consist of other object image & all image were collected using Google search engine.

2.Images were uploaded and converted into greyscale of 64X64 shape.Images were converted into greyscale to reduce the complexity in tuning the model.

3.Data Augmentation part was done by rotating the image by 90,180 and 270. Data augmentation part was done using numpy library so that model can learn more out of all image.

4.Keras model was built using CNN Layer.Keras was used because it is easier to built complex neural network using it and CNN Network are most effecient Neural Network for Image recognition as these layer can learn notable pattern in Image.

5.Dropout method was used used to reduce the overfitting.

6.Then Dataset was divided in Train set and Test set and applied the model.
